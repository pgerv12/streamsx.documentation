IBM® Streams can be used to develop and build applications for edge analytics using IBM Edge Analytics Beta on Cloud Pak for Data.



For more information about Edge Analytics, see the [IBM Edge Analytics Beta on Cloud Pak for Data](https:// https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQNUZ_3.0.1/svc-welcome/edge.html) documentation.



For more information about develop and building edge applications using IBM Streams, see [Moving analytics to the edge with Edge Analytics](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQNUZ_3.0.1/svc-edge/usage.html).
